description: |
  Tux Paint is a free, award-winning drawing program originally created for children ages 3 to 12,
  but enjoyed by all! It combines an easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an encouraging
  cartoon mascot who guides children as they use the program.

  You're presented with a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help them be creative.
  Along with paintbrush, shapes and text, Tux Paint includes a "stamp" feature to add pre-drawn
  or photographic imagery to pictures, and a set of "magic tools" that provide filter effects
  (like blur, tint and waves) and interesting drawing tools (like train tracks, bubbles and grass).

  Tux Paint includes a collection of "starter" images, both coloring-book style and photo-realistic,
  and a large collections of stamps are available as a separate download. Additional content
  can be added by parents & teachers, or downloaded from 3rd parties.

  Tux Paint is available for Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, & Haiku operating systems, among others.
